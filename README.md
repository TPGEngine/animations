## About The Project

This project provides animated explanations of Tangled Program Graphs (TPGs) using Manim, an animation engine for explanatory math videos. It offers a framework for visualizing and understanding complex program graphs through engaging and informative animations. The animations cover various aspects of TPGs, including the challenge of balancing a rod, the evolution of TPG agents, hierarchical structures, and the decision-making process.

### Key Features

- **Manim Integration:** Creates high-quality animations using Manim.
- **TPG Visualization:** Designed to visualize Tangled Program Graphs and their behavior.
- **Modular Structure:** Organizes assets, scenes, and utilities in a clear directory structure.
- **Dependency Management:** Uses `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` for managing project dependencies and ensuring reproducibility.
- **Scene-Based Animations:** Includes scenes for illustrating challenges, evolution, hierarchy, and results related to TPGs.

## Built With

- [Manim](https://www.manim.community/): An animation engine for explanatory math videos.
- [Pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub): Manipulate audio with an simple and easy high level interface.
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv): An extremely fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
  ```sh
  brew install python@3.12 # Example for macOS using Homebrew
  ```
- uv
  ```sh
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```
- Install [Manim Community Edition](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html) locally on your device

### Installation

**Note:** ensure that you have `uv` installed

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tpgengine/animations.git
   cd animations
   ```
2. Install the dependencies using uv:
   ```sh
   uv sync
   ```
3. Running a scene (e.g. EvolutionScene):
   ```sh
   uv run manim -qh scenes/evolution.py EvolutionScene
   ```
