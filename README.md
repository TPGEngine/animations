## About The Project

This project aims to create animated explanations for Tangled Program Graphs (TPGs) using Manim, a powerful animation engine for explanatory math videos. It provides a framework for visualizing and understanding complex program graphs through engaging and informative animations.

### Key Features

- **Manim Integration:** Leverages the capabilities of Manim to create high-quality animations.
- **TPG Visualization:** Specifically designed to visualize Tangled Program Graphs.
- **Modular Structure:** Organized directory structure for assets, scenes, and utilities.
- **Dependency Management:** Uses `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` for managing project dependencies and ensuring reproducibility.

## Built With

- [Manim](https://www.manim.community/): An animation engine for explanatory math videos.
- [Pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub): Manipulate audio with an simple and easy high level interface.
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv): An extremely fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
  ```sh
  brew install python@3.12 # Example for macOS using Homebrew
  ```
- uv
  ```sh
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  ```

### Installation

**Note:** ensure that you have `uv` installed

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tpgengine/animations.git
   cd animations
   ```
2. Install the dependencies using uv:
   ```sh
   uv sync
   ```
